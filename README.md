### Hi there 👋
I'm Sean Wang, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I am a unique combination of an engineering student, a team player, and a social butterfly.

Fun facts
- I have friends
- I have non-engineering hobbies (no kidding), such as traveling and KPop dance 🕺
- Hackathons are my favourite place to socialize. 👩‍💻

Designing and building an idea into a reality, whether it is software, hardware, or even a business project, has always been my cup of tea.

“If something isn’t exactly how you want it, you just make it exactly how you want it”
